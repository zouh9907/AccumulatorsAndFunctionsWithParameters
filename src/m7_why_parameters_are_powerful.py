# DONE: 2.
#   First, RUN this program.  You will see that draw_circles draws
#   concentric circles whose radii vary by 10.
#
#   A function that did the same thing as draw_circles, but allowed
#   for the radii to vary by ANY desired amount would be MORE POWERFUL.
#
#   So, implement TWO functions immediately below this comment.
#   They should be called:
#      run_test_better_draw_circles
#      better_draw_circles
#
#   Your   better_draw_circles  function should have a single PARAMETER
#   that is the amount by which the radii of the circles increase.
#   For example, if that parameter is given the value 10,
#   then the circles have radii:  0  10  20  30  40 ... 200, respectively,
#   just as in   draw_circles1.  But if that parameter is given the
#   value 3, the circles have radii:  0  3  6  9  12  ... 60.
#
#   Your  run_test_better_draw_circles function should TEST your new
#   better_draw_circles function, by calling it with different values
#   for its argument.  Don't forget to put a call to
#   run_test_better_draw_circles  in  main.
#
#   You may find that COPY-AND-PASTE of the  draw_circles  and its
#   run_test_draw_circles  may get you started more quickly on your new
#   better_draw_circles  and  run_test_better_draw_circles.

def better_draw_circles(n):
    window = rg.RoseWindow(400, 400)

    center = rg.Point(200, 200)
    for k in range(21):
        circle = rg.Circle(center, n * k)
        circle.attach_to(window)
        window.render(0.05)  # Pauses for 0.05 seconds after rendering.

def run_test_better_draw_circles(n):
    better_draw_circles(n)


# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# DONE: 3.
#   In the previous exercise, you made a MORE POWERFUL version
#   of draw_circles by introducing a PARAMETER for the amount by
#   which the radii of the concentric circles increase.
#
#   In this exercise, implement TWO MORE functions immediately below
#   this comment. They should be called:
#      run_test_even_better_draw_circles
#      even_better_draw_circles
#
#   Your new   even_better_draw_circles  function should have
#   SEVERAL parameters, for allowing the caller to vary what YOU
#   choose to have the caller vary.  For example, you could have
#   parameters for any or all of the following:
#     -- The amount by which the radii vary (as you did above)
#     -- The number of concentric circles drawn
#     -- The center of the concentric circles
#     -- The outline_color of the concentric circles
#     -- The speed at which the animation runs
#    and more.
#
#   A total of any THREE parameters (of your choosing) is enough,
#   although you may have more.
#
#   In testing your even_better_draw_circles function,
#   can you make some fun pictures?
